- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TobiaszGans
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in smart buildings, IT infrastructure, networking, and security.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Linux and VMs.

I'm using a homelab comprised of a KNX/Loxone smarthome and synology NAS to learn in practice topics that are interesting to me.
