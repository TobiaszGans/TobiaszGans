- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TobiaszGans
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in smart buildings, IT infrastructure, networking, and security.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Linux and VMs.

I'm using a homelab comprised of a KNX/Loxone smarthome and synology NAS to learn and practice tools and topics that I'm interested in.
